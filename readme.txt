= Launch, customise and manage your own online shop assistant =

In today’s online world, consumers can be difficult to please. An abundance of situations can cause uncertainty on your site – and with the click of the mouse, they’re gone.

Perhaps they couldn’t find what they were looking for. Maybe they were looking for the right price. Or they just didn’t have time.

Whichever of these reasons caused them to leave your site, you’ve lost a potential sale and a potential customer.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

= Increase website sales =
With Ve’s Self-service platform you can engage these visitors by providing them with the prompts and suggestions needed to keep them onsite – and help them to make a purchase.

And if they are still determined to leave, Ve’s remarketing solution can send them their shopping cart via email, encouraging them to return and complete their purchase at a time that suits them.

Simple to set-up and manage, and fully customisable to match your brand, Ve’s Self-service platform provides online businesses with the tech to grow, without eating into budgets or time.

= Keep customers on your website =
VePanel is an onsite engagement solution that keeps your visitors onsite and guides them to purchase, outperforming traditional pop-up overlays x2.6.

When a visitor shows signs of leaving, a personalised panel is revealed to the right of the screen. The features within this panel deliver messages and prompts that are of most interest and relevance to the user.

- **Promotional Messaging:** provide personalised incentives including promo codes
- **Recommended Products:** suggest products based on the user’s browsing history and data insights
- **Browsing History:** display and link to the user’s onsite browsing history
- **Product Bookmarking:** email your visitors their basket to purchase at a later date
- **Social Sharing:** drive traffic brand awareness by encouraging customers to share their purchase
- **Product Search:** provide a helpful search bar that incorporates all your products.

= Recover abandoned sales =
Sometimes there is nothing you can do to stop your visitors from leaving your site – but you can and should try to encourage them back. This is exactly where Ve’s email remarketing solution can help.

Firing targeted emails to visitors that leave your site, it provides you with another opportunity to bring them back to your site to complete the purchase when is most convenient to them, increasing your website sales.

“We love the look of the new VePanel. It’s far better than the pop up we used to have and we’re confident it will outperform any other implementation of this kind. We would recommend VePanel and Ve Global to any online retailer”
Ben Greenwood, Marketing Manager, American Soda

“I'm using both VePanel and the remarketing email. The panel works very well, is easy to customise and is well implemented in my website design without disrupting the customer. As for email, it is easy to customise and implement. It works perfectly.

Ve’s technical ability is very good and they respond quickly and efficiently to my queries.”
Juanlu Glez, Store Web Master, Catwalk-669

“Since implementing VePanel, it has been clear to see an extreme increase in not only engagement but also conversions. Claire’s has definitely benefited from the unobtrusive panel and we love the engagement it creates with our customers.”
Ebonie Logan, Global Affiliate Partnership Manager at Claire’s Accessories
